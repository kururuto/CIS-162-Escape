Ps: I feel like you don't need any direction.... Because who wouldn't try to click every button to see what will happen??</div>

        <div class="desc">I was going to make stage 3 a button clicking minigame. But I change it to stage 2. In the draft, my idea was to make the player to click the button 100 times, but that might be too much. So I change it to a fast moving buttton that you have to click it.</div>
